📚 Cybersecurity Books & Learning Resources:

I've curated, educational repository of cybersecurity books and reference materials designed for students, self-taught learners, educators, and early-career security professionals.

This repository focuses on building strong fundamentals, practical understanding, and ethical awareness across multiple cybersecurity domains — from networking and risk management to incident response and emerging threats.

 🔎 Repository Purpose

Cybersecurity is no longer optional. With the rise of cloud computing, IoT, mobile devices, and global connectivity, understanding how to protect systems, networks, and data has become a critical skill for individuals and organizations.

This repository exists to:

* Support students and self-learners** entering cybersecurity
* Assist educators with structured reference materials
* Help SOC / NOC / junior security professionals strengthen core knowledge
* Provide a central, organized learning library for ethical security education

All resources are intended for **learning, research, and defensive security understanding
